## About the game:

Help Doggo escape from the dungeon digging a hole deep enough.

But be careful! The dungeon rooms aren't safe at night, and healing your wounds will take some time.

Try to avoid the dangers you encounter, and make sure Doggo sleeps each day with a full belly and a cozy campfire.

Fully functional with both keyboard and controller.
